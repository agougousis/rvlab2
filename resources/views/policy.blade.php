    1. A job is automatically deleted after {{ $job_max_storagetime }} days.
</p>
<p>
   2. Each user has available at least {{ $soft_limit }} to store his/her input files or the results of submitted jobs.
   This will be called "soft limit". More space can be used by users but in case R vLab runs out of storage, jobs
   will be deleted from users that have exceeded the "soft limit" until the get below the soft-limit. In such a case,
   the job deletion will be done from the oldest job to the newest.
</p>
<p>
    3. Each user can check the utilization of his storage space in the "Workspace File Management" tab. The
    utilization is calculated in accordance to the soft-limit defined above.

    a certain period. You have to select among fixed choices like "1 day", "1 week", "1 month" etc. Please,

    to check out what this lab is about, then select "1 day" or "1 week". This registration is vital in order
    to be able to provide a minimum quality of service to every R vLab user. When the period that you have
    registered for expires, the registration page will appear again to you.
